# Supplementary Information
This GitHub repository contains the supplementary files of the publication: XXXXX.

## How to use these files
This repository belongs to Francisco Manuel Martín-Zamora, Yan Liang (as co-first authors of the associated publication), José María Martín-Durán (as senior co-author), and all other authors of the publication. All files are made publicly available and can be used for further research and other applications. However, if you use these resources in your work, we only ask you to cite our original publication: XXXXX.

## How to download the files
The files inside this repository are of two types. Most of them are `.tar.gz` files stored in [GitHub Large File Storage (LFS)](https://git-lfs.github.com/), whereas there are two in `.xlsx` format uploaded straight to GitHub. To view them, select the `.tar.gz` or `.xslx` file you are interested in (e.g. [Chordin_alignments.tar.gz](Chordin_alignments.tar.gz)), click on *View Raw*, and the file will be downloaded to your device.

## Index of contents
- [ATACseq_coverage.bw.tar.gz](ATACseq_coverage.bw.tar.gz), which contains the ATAC-seq stage-specific coverage files in `.bigwig`/`bw` format.
- [ATACseq_peaks.bed.tar.gz](ATACseq_peaks.bed.tar.gz), which contains the ATAC-seq stage-specific peak set and the consensus peak set in `.bed` format.
- [Chordin_alignments.tar.gz](Chordin_alignments.tar.gz), which contains the multiple sequence alignment (MSA) files in `.fasta`/`.fa` format which were used for the phylogenetic analyses on Chordin. In particular:
  - Chordin_SuppFile1.fa is the "mother" MSA, which contains 15 curated Chordin and Chordin-like protein sequences, an outgroup (human BMP endothelial regulator), and the Chordin and Chordin-like sequences from *Owenia fusiformis*.
  - Chordin_SuppFile2.fa is the "daughter" MSA #1, which contains all sequences from Chordin_SuppFile1.fa and all candidate annelid sequences that contained a 10-residue or longer properly aligned fragment in the CHRD domain region of the MSA.
  - Chordin_SuppFile3.fa is the "daughter" MSA #2, which contains all sequences from Chordin_Suppfile2.fa and all candidate annelid sequences that contained a 10-residue or longer properly aligned fragment in any of the vWFC domain regions of the MSA.
